It has been suggested that this article should be split into articles titled List of 2 euro commemoratives (2004–2009), List of 2 euro commemoratives (2010–2019) and List of 2 euro commemoratives (2020–2029). (discuss) (February 2023)
€2 commemorative coins are special euro coins that have been minted and issued by member states of the eurozone since 2004 as legal tender in all eurozone member states.

€2 coins are the only denomination intended for circulation that may be issued as commemorative coins. Only the national obverse sides of the commemorative coins differ; the common reverse sides do not. The coins typically commemorate the anniversaries of historical events or current events of special importance.

Since 2012, the number of commemorative coins has been limited to two per country per year; previously only one was allowed. Issues of common commemoratives or a vacant head of state do not count towards the limit. The total number of commemorative coins placed in circulation per year is also limited. The commemorative coins must follow the design standards stipulated for regular €2 coins, with design limitations to guarantee uniformity.

Up to the end of 2023, 513 variations of €2 commemorative coins have been issued. Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, San Marino and the Vatican City are the only countries to have released at least one commemorative coin every year since 2004.

Though they have become collectibles, €2 commemoratives are different from non-standard denomination commemorative euro coins, which are officially designated as "collector coins", not intended for circulation and usually made of precious metals.[1]

Regulations and restrictions
Commemorative coins shall bear a different national design from that of the regular coins and shall only commemorate subjects of major national or European relevance. Commemorative coins issued collectively by all Member States whose currency is the euro shall only commemorate subjects of the highest European relevance and their design shall be without prejudice to the possible constitutional requirements of these Member States. The 2-euro coin constitutes the most suitable denomination for this purpose, principally on account of the large diameter of the coin and its technical characteristics, which offer adequate protection against counterfeiting.

The basis for the euro coins is derived from a European recommendation from 2003, which allowed changing the national obverse sides of euro coins from 1 January 2004 onwards.[2]

Regarding them, a series of restrictions apply:[3][4][1]

Commemorative coins have a different national face than usual and keep the common face.
They are intended to commemorate some relevant event or personality at a national or European level.
Each State can only issue one commemorative coin per year and always in the format of 2 euros. Since 2013, two commemorative coins per year are allowed.
The joint commemorative issues carried out by all the States of the eurozone (that is to say, excluding the euro-issuing States that do not belong to the EU), are additional to the emissions carried out by each State individually.
In the event that the State Headquarters is vacant or provisionally occupied, that State may issue an additional commemorative coin.
The legend engraved on the edge of the commemorative euro coins intended for circulation must be the same as that on the normal euro coins intended for circulation.
They have limited the maximum volume of emission.
The total number of such coins put into circulation per year should not surpass the higher of the following two numbers:[5]

0.1% of the total number of €2 coins put into circulation by all members of the eurozone. This limit can exceptionally be increased to up to 2.0 per cent if the coin commemorates a very important and noteworthy event; in this case, the member state issuing this higher number of coins should refrain from putting any commemorative coins into circulation for the following four years.
5.0% of the total number of €2 coins put into circulation by the member state issuing the €2 commemorative coin.
Since 2005, the recommendations for the design of the national sides of all the coins have been modified, which has also affected the designs of the €2 commemorative coins of the following years. See euro coins for more information.[where?]

The different States must inform each other of the new draft designs (both of the "regular" coins and the 2 euro commemorative coins) as well as the European Council and the European Commission, which must give your approval. One consequence of the above was the case of the 2 euro commemorative coin that Belgium planned to issue in 2015 on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, which caused complaints from France and Belgium's resignation from issuing such a coin. However, Belgium issued a collector's coin of 2.50 euros, taking advantage of the fact that these coins are not submitted to the prior information of their draft designs.

Due to special laws requiring that every coin bear the incumbent Grand Duke's portrait, the Luxembourgish edition of the common €2 commemorative coin differs slightly from the others in addition to the translated inscriptions, since a latent image of the Grand Duke's portrait was added (as required by national law) using a technique called multi-view minting.[66]
A similar Dutch law, which requires the portrait of the current head of state of the Netherlands and the words NAME (Koning/Koningin) der Nederlanden to appear on all coins issued by the Netherlands (for example, currently Willem-Alexander Koning der Nederlanden) was amended so that the Netherlands could take part in this program; the amendment completely removed the requirement for €2 commemorative coins.

Furthermore, due to Belgium's special multilingual society, the Belgian coin features the inscription PACTVM ROMANVM QVINQVAGENARIVM in Latin.

The three micro-states which also used the euro due to an official agreement with the European Union (Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City) did not issue this coin, as they are not member states of the European Union. However, some member states of the European Union which had not yet introduced the euro also took part in this program. For example, Cyprus issued a £1 coin and Hungary a 50 Ft coin with the same design.

[417]	 European Union	35 years of the Erasmus Programme	36,771,000 coins	1 July 2022
Description: To celebrate 35 years of the Eramus programme, euro-area Finance Ministers decided that euro-area Member States would strike a 2-euro commemorative coin using a common design on the national side. The public selected the winning design by web-voting. Voters had a choice of six designs, which had been pre-selected by a professional jury following a design competition among euro area Member States, and they chose the design created by Mr Joaquin Jimenez, professional designer at the Monnaie de Paris. The design is a mix of two major elements of the Erasmus programme: the original intellectual inspiration, Erasmus himself, and the allegory of its influence over Europe. The first one is symbolised by one of the most known depiction of Erasmus. The second one is symbolised by a beam of links going across the coin from a beacon to another, representing the numerous intellectual and human exchanges between the European students. As a reference to Europe, some of these links form other stars, born from the synergy between the countries. The figure 35, for 35th anniversary comes out from the stars in a contemporary graphical style. Next to the right hand of Erasmus are the initials of the designer (J.J.). The indication 1987-2022, the words ERASMUS PROGRAMME in different languages and the name(s) of the issuing country in the national language(s) (or an abbreviation) appear too. The outer ring depicts the twelve stars of the European flag.
