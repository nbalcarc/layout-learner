tartan 
scottish gaelic
 breacan 
xk
 is a patterned cloth with crossing horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours
 forming simple or complex rectangular patterns
 tartans originated in woven wool
 but are now made in other materials
 tartan is particularly associated with scotland
 and scottish kilts almost always have tartan patterns
outside of scotland
 tartan is sometimes also known as 
plaid
particularly in north america
 however
 in scotland
 a plaid is a large piece of tartan cloth which can be worn several ways
traditional tartan is made with alternating bands of coloured 
pre
dyed
 threads woven in usually matching warp and weft in a simple 
 twill pattern
 up close
 this pattern forms alternating short diagonal lines where different colours cross
 from further back
 it gives the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones
 the resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of rectangles and lines known as a sett
scottish tartan was originally associated with the highlands
 early tartans were only particular to locales
 rather than any specific scottish clan
 like other materials
 tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes
 using the most available natural dyes
 the dress act of 
 attempted to bring the warrior clans there under government control by banning highland dress
 then an important element of gaelic scottish culture
 when the law was repealed in 
 tartan was no longer ordinary dress for most highlanders
 it was adopted more widely as the symbolic national dress of all scotland when king george iv wore a tartan kilt in his 
 visit to scotland
 it was promoted further by queen victoria
 this marked an era of rather politicised 
tartanry
 and 
highlandism
while the first uniform tartan is believed to date to 
with some evidence of militia use earlier
 it was not until around the early 
th century that patterns were created for specific scottish clans
 most of the traditional ones were established between 
 and 
 the victorian
era invention of artificial dyes meant that a multitude of patterns could be produced cheaply
 mass
produced tartan fashion cloth was applied to a nostalgic 
and increasingly aristocratic
 and profitable
 view of scottish history
today tartan is no longer limited to textiles
 but is also used as a name for the pattern itself
 regardless of medium
 the use of tartan has spread outside scotland
 especially to countries that have been influenced by scottish culture
 however
 tartan
styled patterns have existed for centuries in some other cultures
 such as japan
 where complex k
shi fabrics date to at least the 
th century
 and russia 
sometimes with gold and silver thread
 since at least the early 
th century
 maasai sh
 wraps
 bhutanese mathra weaving
 and indian madras cloth are also often in tartan patterns
 distinct from the scottish style
etymology and terminology
the english and scots word tartan is possibly derived from french tiretaine meaning 
linsey
woolsey cloth
 other hypotheses are that it derives from scottish gaelic tarsainn or tarsuinn
 meaning 
across
 or 
crossing over
 or from french tartarin or tartaryn 
occurring in 
 spelled tartyn
 meaning 
tartar cloth
 it is unrelated to the superficially similar word tarlatan
 which refers to a very open
weave muslin similar to cheesecloth
 tartan is both a mass noun 
 metres of tartan
 and a count noun 
 different tartans
today
 tartan refers to coloured patterns
 though originally did not have to be made up of a pattern at all
 as it referred to the type of weave
 as late as the 
 some tartan cloth was described as 
plain coloured 
 without pattern
 patterned cloth from the gaelic
speaking scottish highlands was called breacan
 meaning 
many colours
 over time
 the meanings of tartan and breacan were combined to describe a certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth
the pattern of a particular tartan is called its sett
 the sett is made up of a series of lines at specific widths which cross at right angles and blend into each other
 the longer term setting is occasionally used
 sett can refer to either the minimal visual presentation of the complete tartan pattern or to a textual representation of it 
in a thread count
today tartan is used more generally to describe the pattern
 not limited to textiles
 appearing on media such as paper
 plastics
 packaging
 and wall coverings
in north america
 the term plaid is commonly used to refer to tartan
 plaid
 derived from the scottish gaelic plaide meaning 
blanket
 was first used of any rectangular garment
 sometimes made up of tartan
 which could be worn several ways
 the belted plaid 
breacan f
ile
 or 
great kilt
 which preceded the modern kilt
 the arisaid 
earasaid
 a large shawl that could be wrapped into a dress
 and several types of shoulder cape
 such as the full plaid and fly plaid
 in time
 plaid was used to describe blankets themselves
 in former times
 the term plaiding
 or pladding
 was sometimes used to refer to tartan cloth
weaving and design
weaving construction

 twill weave
 the black weft threads go two over then two under the orange warp threads
 staggered by one thread each pass 
resulting in a diagonal pattern
 in the actual cloth

the scottish register of tartans provides the following summary definition of tartan
tartan 
the design
 is a pattern that comprises two or more different solid
coloured stripes that can be of similar but are usually of differing proportions that repeat in a defined sequence
 the sequence of the warp colours 
long
ways threads
 is repeated in same order and size in the weft 
cross
ways threads
 the majority of such patterns 
or setts
 are symmetrical
 i
 the pattern repeats in the same colour order and proportions in every direction from the two pivot points
 in the less common asymmetric patterns
 the colour sequence repeats in blocks as opposed to around alternating pivots but the size and colour sequence of warp and weft remain the same

 this is a five

 and crimson red
in more detail
 traditional tartan cloth is a tight
 staggered 
 twill weave of worsted wool
 the horizontal weft 
also woof or fill
 is woven in a simple arrangement of two
over
two
under the fixed
 vertical warp
 advancing one thread at each pass
 as each thread in the weft crosses threads in the warp
 the staggering by one means that each warp thread will also cross two weft threads
 the result
 when the material is examined closely
 is a characteristic 
degree diagonal pattern of 
ribs
 where different colours cross
 where a thread in the weft crosses threads of the same colour in the warp
 this produces a solid colour on the tartan
 while a weft thread crossing warp threads of a different colour produces an equal admixture of the two colours alternating
 producing the appearance of a third colour 
 a halftone blend or mixture 
 when viewed from further back
the effect is similar to multicolour halftone printing
 or cross
hatching in coloured
pencil art
 thus
 a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one blend
 increasing quadratically with the number of base colours
 so a set of six base colours produces fifteen blends and a total of twenty
one different perceived colours
 this means that the more stripes and colours used
 the more blurred and subdued the tartan
s pattern becomes
 unlike in simple checker 
chequer
 or dicing patterns 
like a chessboard
 no solid colour in a tartan appears next to another solid colour
 only a blend
solid colours may touch at their corners
james d
 scarlett 
 offered a definition of a usual tartan pattern 
some types of tartan deviate from the particulars of this definition 
 see below
the unit of tartan pattern
 the sett
 is a square
 composed of a number of rectangles
 square and oblong
 arranged symmetrically around a central square
 each of these elements occurs four times
 at intervals of ninety degrees
 and each is rotated ninety degrees in relation to its fellows
 the proportions of the elements are determined by the relative widths of the stripes that form them
the sequence of thread colours in the sett 
the minimal design of the tartan
 to be duplicated
the dna of a tartan
 starts at an edge and either reverses or 
rarely
 repeats on what are called pivot points or pivots
 in diagram a
 the sett begins at the first pivot
 reverses at the second pivot
 continues
 then reverses again at the next pivot
 and will carry on in this manner horizontally
 in diagram b
 the sett proceeds in the same way as in the warp but vertically
 the diagrams illustrate the construction of a typical symmetric
also symmetrical
 reflective
 reversing
 or mirroring
 tartan
 however
 on a rare asymmetric
asymmetrical
 or non
reversing
 tartan
 the sett does not reverse at the pivots
 it just repeats at them
 an old term for the latter type is cheek or cheeck pattern
 also
 some tartans 
very few among traditional scottish tartans
 do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft
 this means the warp and weft will have differing thread counts 
see below
 asymmetric and differing
warp
and
weft patterns are more common in madras cloth 
see 
 indian madras
 below
 and some other weaving traditions than in scottish tartan

a tartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett
 the thread count 
or threadcount
 thread
count
 not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett
 but also the colours used 
typically abbreviated
 usually every number in a thread count is an even number
 to assist in manufacture
 the first and last threads of the thread count are the pivots
 a thread count combined with exact colour information and other weaving details is referred to as a ticket stamp
 or simply ticket
tartan weaving in lochcarron
 scottish highlands
there is no universally standardised way to write a thread count
 but the different systems are easy to distinguish
 as a simple example
the thread count 
 r
 k
 y
 corresponds to a mirroring pattern of 
 black threads
 red threads
 black threads
 yellow threads
 in which the beginning black and ending yellow pivots are not repeated 
after y
 the colours are reversed
 first k
 then r
 this is a 
full
count at the pivots
 thread count
an equivalent notation is boldfacing the pivot abbreviations
 k
 r
 k
 y
the same tartan could also be represented as 
 r
 k
 y
 in markup that indicates that the leading black and trailing yellow are duplicated before continuing from these pivot points 
after y
 the colours are reversed as y
 again
 then k
 then r
 this is a 
half
count at the pivots
 thread count
in the older and potentially ambiguous style of thread
counting
 without the 
or bold
 notation
 a thread count like 
 r
 k
 y
 is assumed to be full
count at the pivots
 unless the author clearly indicates otherwise
in all of these cases
 the result is a half
sett thread count
 which represents the threading before the pattern mirrors and completes
 a full
sett thread count for a mirroring 
symmetric
 tartan is redundant
 a 
 can also be used between two colour codes 
 for 
white
yellow 
 to create even more of a shorthand threadcount for simple tartans in which half of the half
sett pattern is different from the other only in the way of a colour swap
 but this is not a common style of thread
counting
an asymmetric tartan
 one that does not mirror
 would be represented in a full
sett thread count with 
 markup
 as 
 r
 k
 y
after y
 the entire pattern would begin again from k
various writers and tartan databases do not use a consistent set of colour names 
see 
 colour
 palettes
 and meaning
 below
 and abbreviations
 so a thread count may not be universally understandable without a colour key
legend
 some recorders prefer to begin a thread count at the pivot with the colour name 
or abbreviation
 that is first in alphabetical order 
 if there is a white pivot and a blue one
 begin with blue
 but this is actually arbitrary
though thread counts are quite specific
 they can be modified depending on the desired size of the tartan
 for example
 the sett of a tartan 
 inches square 
 a typical size for kilts
 may be too large to fit upon the face of a necktie
 in this case
 the thread count would be reduced in proportion 
 to 
 inches to a side
 in some works
 a thread count is reduced to the smallest even number of threads 
often down to 
 required to accurately reproduce the design
 in such a case
 it is often necessary to up
scale the thread count proportionally for typical use in kilts and plaids
before the 
th century
 tartan was often woven with thread for the weft that was up to 
 thicker than the fine thread used for the warp
 which would result in a rectangular rather than square pattern
 the solution was to adjust the weft thread count to return the pattern to square
 or make it non
square on purpose
 as is still done in a handful of traditional tartans
 uneven warp
and
weft thread thickness could also contribute to a striped rather than checked appearance in some tartan samples
the predominant colours of a tartan 
the widest bands
 are called the under
check 
or under check
 undercheck
 under
cheque
 sometimes the terms ground
 background
 or base
 are used instead
 especially if there is only one dominant colour
 thin
 contrasting lines are referred to as the over
check
also over
stripe or overstripe
 over
checks in pairs are sometimes referred to as tram lines
 tramlines
 or tram tracks
 bright over
checks are sometimes bordered on either side 
usually both
 for extra contrast
 by additional thin lines
 often black
 called guard lines or guards
 historically
 the weaver william wilson 
 son of bannockburn sometimes wove bright over
checks in silk
 to give some added shine

 but in regimental officers

an old
time practice
 to the 
th century
 was to add an accent on plaids or sometimes kilts in the form of a selvedge in herringbone weave at the edge
 inches 
 cm
 wide
 but still fitting into the colour pattern of the sett
 a few modern weavers will still produce some tartan in this style
 sometimes more decorative selvedges were used
 selvedge marks were borders 
usually on one side only
 formed by repeating a colour from the sett in a broad band 
often in herringbone
 sometimes further bordered by a thin strip of another colour from the sett or decorated in mid
selvedge with two thin strips
 these were typically used for the bottoms of belted plaids and kilts
 and were usually black in military tartans
 but could be more colourful in civilian ones
 the more elaborate selvedge patterns were a wider series of narrow stripes using some or all of the colours of the sett
 these were almost exclusively used on household tartans 
blankets
 curtains
 etc
 and on two opposing sides of the fabric
 the very rare total border is an all
four
sides selvedge of a completely different sett
 described by peter eslea macdonald 
 as 
an extraordinarily difficult feature to weave and can be regarded as the zenith of the tartan weaver

tartan is usually woven balanced
warp 
or just balanced
 repeating evenly from a pivot point at the centre outwards and with a complete sett finishing at the outer selvedge
 e
 a piece of tartan for a plaid might be 
 setts long and 
 wide
 an offset
 off
set
 or unbalanced weave is one in which the pattern finishes at the edge in the middle of a pivot colour
 this was typically done with pieces intended to be joined 
 for a belted plaid or a blanket
 to make larger spans of cloth with the pattern continuing across the seam
 if the tartan had a selvedge mark or selvedge pattern
 it was at the other side of the warp
the term hard tartan refers to a version of the cloth woven with very tightly wound
 non
fuzzy thread
 producing a comparatively rougher and denser 
though also thinner
 material than is now typical for kilts
 it was in common use up until the 
 there are extant but uncommon samples of hard tartan from the early 
th century that use the more intricate herringbone instead of twill weave throughout the entire cloth
while modern tartan is primarily a commercial enterprise on large power looms
 tartan was originally the product of rural weavers of the pre
industrial age
 and can be produced by a dedicated hobbyist with a strong
 stable hand loom
 since around 
 the traditional size of the warp reed for tartan is 
 inches 
 cm
 the length of the scottish ell 
previous sizes were sometimes 
 and 
 inches
 telfer dunbar 
 describes the setup thus
the reed varies in thickness according to the texture of the material to be woven
 a thirty
porter 
which contains 
 splits of the reed
 or 
reed
 is divided into 
 openings in the breadth of 
 inches
 twenty of these openings are called a porter and into each opening are put two threads
 making 
 threads of warp and as many of weft in a square yard of tartan through a 
porter reed
splits are also referred to as dents
 and porters are also called gangs
styles and design principles
traditional tartan patterns can be divided into several style classes
 the most basic is a simple two
colour check of thick bands 
with or without thin over
checks of one or more other colours
 a variant on this splits one or more of the bands
 to form squares of smaller squares instead of just big
 solid squares
 a style heavily favoured in vestiarium scoticum
 a complexity step up is the superimposed check
 in which a third colour is placed centrally 
on top of
 or 
inside
surrounded by
 one of the base under
check colours
 providing a pattern of nested squares
 which might then also have thin
 bright and
or black over
checks added
 another group is multiple checks
 typically of two broad bands of colour on a single dominant 
background
 red
 blue
 red
 green
 red 
 again possibly with contrasting narrow over
checks
 the aforementioned types can be combined into more complex tartans
 in any of these styles
 an over
check is sometimes not a new colour but one of the under
check colours 
on top of
 the other under
check
 a rare style
 traditionally used for arisaid 
earasaid
 tartans but no longer in much if any scottish use
 is a pattern consisting entirely of thin over
checks
 sometimes grouped
on
 a single ground colour
 usually white
 m
 martin 
 reported that the line colours were typically blue
 black
 and red
 examples of this style do not survive
 at least not in the tartan databases 
there may be preserved museum pieces with such patterns
 some tartan patterns are more abstract and do not fit into any of these styles
 especially in madras cloth

there are no codified rules or principles of tartan design
 but a few writers have offered some considered opinions
 banks 
 de la chapelle 
 summarized
 with a view to broad
 general tartan use
 including for fashion
color 
 and how it is worked 
 is pivotal to tartan design
 thus
 tartans should be composed of clear
 bright colors
 but ones sufficiently soft to blend well and thereby create new shades
 james d
 scarlett 
 noted
the more colours to begin with
 the more subdued the final effect
 or put more precisely
the more stripes to the sett and the more colours used
 the more diffuse and 
blurred
 the pattern
 that does not necessarily translate into subtlety
 a tartan of many colours and stripes can seem 
busy
scarlett 
 after extensive research into historical highland patterns 
which were dominated by rich red and medium green in about equal weight with dark blue as a blending accent 
 not accounting for common black lines
 suggested that for a balanced and traditional style
any basic tartan type of design should have for its background
 a 
high impact
 colour and two others
 of which one should be the complement to the first and the other a darker and more neutral shade
 other colours
 introduced to break up the pattern or as accents
 should be a matter of taste
 it is important that no colour should be so strong as to 
swamp
 another
 otherwise
 the blending of colours at the crossing will be adversely affected
 tartan is a complex abstract art
form with a strong mathematical undertone
 far removed from a simple check with a few lines of contrasting colours scattered over it
scarlett 
 provided a more general explanation
 traditional styles aside
colours for tartan work require to be clear and unambiguous and bright but soft
 to give good contrast of both colour and brightness and to mix well so as to give distinctly new shades where two colours cross without any one swamping another
further
 scarlett 
 held that 
background checks will show a firm but not harsh contrast and the overchecks will be such as to show clearly
 on the under
check 
or 
background
 colours
 he summed up the desired total result as 
a harmonious blend of colour and pattern worthy to be looked upon as an art form in its own right
omitting traditional black lines has a strong softening effect
 as in the 
s missoni fashion ensemble 
top right
 and in many madras patterns

there is no set of exact colour standards for tartan hues
 thread colour varies from weaver to weaver even for 
the same
 colour
 a certain range of general colours
 however
 are traditional in scottish tartan
 these include blue 
dark
 crimson 
rose or dark red

 some additional colours that have been used more rarely are azure 
light or sky blue
 maroon
 and vert 
bright or grass green
 plus light grey 
as seen in balmoral tartan
 though it is sometimes given as lavender
 since the opening of the tartan databases to registration of newly designed tartans
 including many for organisational and fashion purposes
 a wider range of colours have been involved
 such as orange
 and pink
 which were not often used 
as distinct colours rather than as renditions of red
 in old traditional tartans
 the scottish register of tartans uses a long list of colours keyed to hexadecimal 
web colours
 sorting groups of hues into a constrained set of basic codes 
but expanded upon the above traditional list
 with additional options like dark orange
 dark yellow
 light purple
 etc
 this helps designers fit their creative tartan into a coding scheme while allowing weavers to produce an approximation of that design from readily stocked yarn supplies
in the mid
th century
 the natural dyes that had been traditionally used in the highlands
like various lichens
 alder bark
 bilberry
 cochineal
 heather
 indigo
 woad
 and yellow bedstraw
 began to be replaced by artificial dyes
 which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry
 though also less subtle
 although william morris in the late
th
century arts and crafts movement tried to revive use of british natural dyes
 most were so low
yield and so inconsistent from locality to locality 
part of the reason for the historical tartan differentiation by area
 that they proved to have little mass
production potential
 despite some purple dye 
cudbear
 commercialisation efforts in glasgow in the 
th century
 the hard
wound
 fine wool used in tartan weaving was rather resistant to natural dyes
 and some dye baths required days or even weeks
 the dyeing also required mordants to fix the colours permanently
 usually metallic salts like alum
 there are records from 
 of alum being imported to leith
 though not necessarily all for tartan production in particular
 some colours of dye were usually imported
 especially red cochineal and to some extent blue indigo 
both expensive and used to deepen native dyes
 from the low countries
 with which scotland had extensive trade since the 
th century
 aged human urine 
called fual or graith
 was also used
 as a colour
deepener
 a dye solubility agent
 a lichen fermenter
 and a final colour
fastness treatment
 all commercially manufactured tartan today is coloured using artificial not natural dyes
 even in the less saturated colour palettes
the hues of colours in any established tartan can be altered to produce variations of the same tartan
 such varying of the hues to taste dates to at least the 
 pattern book of manufacturer william wilson 
 son of bannockburn
 today
 the semi
standardised colour schemes or palettes 
what marketers might call 
colourways
 are divided generally into modern
 ancient
 muted
 and weathered 
sometimes with other names
 depending on weaver
 these terms only refer to relative dye 
colourfulness
 saturation levels and do not represent distinct tartans
modern
also known as ordinary
 refers to darker tartan
 with fully saturated colours
 in a modern palette
 setts made up of blue
 black
 and green tend to be obscured because of the darkness of the colours in this scheme
ancient
also known as old colours 
oc
 refers to a lighter palette of tartan
 these hues are ostensibly meant to represent the colours that would result from natural
dyed fabric aging over time
 however
 the results are not accurate 
 in real examples of very old tartan
 black often fades toward khaki
 or green
 while blue remains dark
 and natural dyes are capable of producing some very vibrant colours in the first place
 though not very consistently
 this style originated in the first half of the 
th century
 this ancient is not to be confused with the same word in a few names of tartans such as 
ancient campbell
weathered
also called faded
 refers to tartan that is even lighter 
less saturated
 than ancient
 as if exposed for a very long time
 this style was invented in the late 
muted
refers to tartan which is between modern and ancient in vibrancy
 although this type of colouring is very recent
 dating only from the early 
 these hues are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid
th century
some particular tartan mills have introduced other colour schemes that are unique to that weaver and only available in certain tartans
 two examples are lochcarron
s antique
 between modern and ancient
 and d
 c
 dalgliesh
s reproduction
 a slight variation on weathered
 dating to the 
s and claimed to be based on 
th
century samples
a general observation about ancient
old
 weathered
faded
 and muted are that they rather uniformly reduce the saturation of all colours
 while actual natural
dyed tartan samples show that the historical practice was usually to pair one or more saturated colours with one or more pale ones
 for greater clarity and depth
 a 
harmonious balance
 according to scarlett 
the colours were clear
 bright and soft
 altogether unlike the eye

the idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one
 notwithstanding a legend that red tartans were 
battle tartans
 designed so they would not show blood
 it is only recently created tartans
 such as canadian provincial and territorial tartans 
beginning 
 and us state tartans 
beginning 
 that are stated to be designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used
 for example
 green sometimes represents prairies or forests
 blue can represent lakes and rivers
 and yellow might stand for various crops
 in the scottish register of tartans 
and the databases before it
 colour inspiration notes are often recorded by a tartan
s designer
 however
 there is no common set of tartan colour or pattern 
motifs
 with allusive meanings that is shared among designers
more abstractly
 from an art criticism perspective
 design historian richard martin 
 wrote of tartans as designs and tartan as a textile class having no truly endemic or objectified meanings
 but being an art that 
has the property of being a vessel or container of meaning
 a design form that exists not only in history but through history
 capable of conveying radically different
 even contradictory
 contextual meanings 
ever changing and evolving
 through socio
cultural transmutation of the fabric
s use
 thus tartan could veer from symbol of anti
union and jacobite highland rebellion to emblem of pan
british loyalty to empire in the space of two generations
 or serve different fashion markets in the same recent decades as both a sartorial status symbol of traditional values and a punk and grunge rebel banner
early history
pre
medieval origins
classical roman writers made various references to the continental gauls
 south of britain
 wearing striped or variegated clothing
 latin seems to have lacked an exact word for 
checked
 for example
 virgil in the aeneid 
 bc
 book viii
 line 
 described the gauls as virgatis lucent sagulis 
or sagalis
 meaning something like 
they shine in striped cloaks
 or 
their cloaks are striped brightly
 other writers used words such as pictae and virgatae
 with translations like 
marled
variegated
particoloured
 etc
 scarlett 
 warns
what is not reasonable is the ready assumption by many modern authors that every time one of these words
 or something like it
 was used
 tartan was intended
 it might have been intended sometimes
 or the writer might have just meant linear stripes like seersucker cloth
 both scarlett and thompson 
 decry the unsustainable assumption by a few earlier modern writers 
 james grant
 that gauls must have been running around in clan tartans
 the romans particularly wrote of gauls as wearing striped braccae 
trousers
 e
 g
 cody in remarks in his 
 edition of john lesley
s historie of scotland hypothesized that this was actually a gaulish loanword and was cognate with gaelic breacan
 this is one of many 
tartan legends
 that is not well accepted
 rather
 braccae is considered by modern linguists a cognate of english breeches
 gaelic briogais 
trousers
 etc
the earliest documented tartan
like cloth in britain
 known as the 
falkirk tartan
 dates from the 
rd century ad
 it was uncovered at falkirk in stirlingshire
 scotland
 near the antonine wall
 the fragment
 held in the national museum of scotland
 was stuffed into the mouth of an earthenware pot containing almost 
 roman coins
 the falkirk tartan has a simple 
border check
 design
 of undyed light and dark wool
 other evidence from this period is the surviving fragment of a statue of roman emperor caracalla
 once part of the triumphal arch of volubilis completed in 
 ad
 it depicts a caledonian pictish prisoner wearing tartan trews 
represented by carving a checked design then inlaying it with bronze and silver alloys to give a variegated appearance
 based on such evidence
 tartan researcher james d
 scarlett 
 believes scottish tartan to be 
of pictish or earlier origin
 though brown 
 notes there is no way to prove or disprove this
early forms of tartan like this are thought to have been invented in pre
roman times
 and would have been popular among the inhabitants of the northern roman provinces
 as well as in other parts of northern europe such as jutland
 where the same pattern was prevalent
 and bronze age sweden
that twill weave was selected
 even in ancient times
 is probably no accident
plain 
 twill for a given gauge of yarn
 yields a cloth 
 heavier 
denser
 and hence more weather
proof 
 than the simple 
 weave
 according to scarlett 
here are sound reasons why such a type of pattern
textile should have developed almost automatically in isolated
 self
sufficient 
 communities
 such communities are unlikely to possess large dye
vats
 and so cannot piece
dye woven cloth
 such processes as batik and tie
dye are unavailable
 stripes are the practical solution
 since they use small quantities of a colour at a time and are interspersed with other colours
 but the scope is limited 
 stripes across both brighten the colours and add many mixtures
 from there on it is really only a matter of getting organised
 the now
geometric pattern reduces to a small unit
 easier to remember and to follow in a world where little was written down
 it is further simplified by being split into two equal halves and
 with weft as warp
 the weft pattern can be followed from the warp

there is little written or pictorial evidence about tartan 
much less surviving tartan cloth
 from the medieval era
 tartan use in britain between the 
rd
century falkirk tartan and 
th
century samples
 writings
 and art is unclear
 cosmo innes 
 wrote that
 according to medieval hagiographies
 scots of the 
th
th centuries 
used cloaks of variegated colour
 apparently of home manufacture
 based on similarities of tartans used by various clans
 including the murrays
 sutherlands
 and gordons
 and the history of their family interactions over the centuries
 thomas innes of learney estimated that a regional 
parent
 pattern
 of a more general style
 might date to the 
th or 
th century
 but this is quite speculative
 the cartularies of aberdeen in the 
th century barred clergymen from wearing 
striped
 clothing
 which could have referred to tartan
in 
 italian gothic artists simone martini and lippo memmi produced the annunciation with st
 margaret and st
 ansanus
 a wood
panel painting in tempera and gold leaf
 it features the archangel gabriel in a tartan
patterned mantle
 with light highlights where the darker stripes meet
 perhaps representing jewels
 embroidery
 or supplementary weaving
 art historians consider it an example of 
tartar
mongol
 textile influence
 it likely has no relation to scottish tartan
tartar
 cloth came in a great array of patterns
 many more complex than tartan 
such as the fine detail in gabriel
s robe in the same painting
 patterns of this sort were influential especially on italian art in the 
th century
there are several other continental european paintings of tartan
like garments from around this era 
even back to the 
th century
 but most of them show very simple two
colour basic check patterns
 or 
like the martini and memmi annunciation example
 broad squares made by thin lines of one colour on a background of another
 any of them could represent embroidery or patchwork rather than woven tartan
 there seems to be no indication in surviving records of tartan material being imported from scotland in this period
 in the second half of the 
th century
 the artist known only as the 
master of estamariu
in catalonia
 spain
 painted an altarpiece of st vincent
 one of the details of which is a man in a cotehardie that is red on one half and a complex three
colour tartan on the other
 which is very similar to later
attested scottish tartans
sir francis james grant
 mid

 noted that records showed the wearing of tartan in scotland to date as far back as

of a type also seen in period irish art
 with claymore and dirk
 it looks much like medieval illustrations of 
tartar
 cloth and thus cannot be certain to represent true tartan
 by the late 
th century
 there are numerous references to striped or checked plaids
 supposedly
 the earliest pattern that is still produced today 
though not in continual use
 is the lennox district tartan
also adopted as the clan tartan of lennox
 said to have been reproduced by d
 w
 stewart in 
 from a portrait of margaret douglas
 countess of lennox
 dating to around 
 however
 this seems to be legend
 as no modern tartan researchers or art historians have identified such a portrait
 and the earliest known realistic one of a woman in tartan dates much later
 to c
 extant portraits of margaret show her in velvet and brocade
tartan and highland dress in the elizabethan era have been said to have become essentially classless
 worn in the highlands by everyone from high
born lairds to common crofters
 at least by the late 
th century
 the historian john major wrote in 
 that it was the upper class
 including warriors
 who wore plaids while the common among them wore linen
 suggesting that woollen cloth was something of a luxury
 but by 
 bishop john lesley of ross wrote that the belted plaid was the general highland costume of both rich and poor
 with the nobility simply able to afford larger plaids with more colours
later
 burt 
 also wrote of gentlemen having larger plaids than commoners
 if colours conveyed distinction
 it was of social class not clan
 d
 w
 stewart 
 attributed the change
 away from linen
 to broader manufacture of woollen cloth and 
the increased prosperity of the people
many writers of the period drew parallels between irish and highland dress
 especially the wearing of a long yellow
dyed shirt called the l
ine or saffron shirt 
though probably not actually dyed with expensive imported saffron
 worn with a mantle 
cloak
 over it
 and sometimes with trews
 it is not entirely certain when these mantles were first made of tartan in the highlands
 but the distinctive cloth seems to get its recorded mentions first in the 
th century
 starting with major 
 in 
 jean de beaugu
 a french witness of scottish troops on the continent at the 
 siege of haddington
 distinguished lowlanders from highland 
savages
 and wrote of the latter as wearing shirts 
and a certain light covering made of wool of various colours
 george buchanan in 
 wrote that 
plaids of many colours
 had a long tradition but that the highland fashion by his era had mostly shifted to a plainer look
 especially brown tones
 as a practical matter of camouflage

 the crude attempt to represent tartan shows a blue and green pattern with red over
check
 but did not blend the colours
its dense weave requiring specialised skills and equipment
 tartan was not generally one individual
s work but something of an early cottage industry in the highlands 
 an often communal activity called calanas
 including some associated folk singing traditions 
 with several related occupational specialties 
wool comber
 dyer
 waulker
 warp
winder
 weaver
 among people in a village
 part
time or full
time
 especially women
aa
 the spinning wheel was a late technological arrival in the highlands
 and tartan in this era was woven from fine 
but fairly inconsistent
 hard
spun yarn that was spun by hand on drop spindles
 the era
s commerce in tartans was centred on inverness
 the early business records of which are filled with many references to tartan goods
 tartan patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of particular areas
 owing in part to differences in availability of natural dyes
 and it was common for highlanders to wear whatever was available to them
 often a number of different tartans at the same time
ab
 the early tartans found in east
coastal scotland used red more often
 probably because of easier continental
european trade in the red dye cochineal
 while western tartans were more often in blues and greens
 owing to the locally available dyes
see also 
 colour
 palettes
 and meaning
 the greater expense of red dye may have also made it a status symbol
 tartan spread at least somewhat out of the highlands
 but was not universally well received
 the general assembly of the kirk of scotland in 
 prohibited the ministers and readers of the church 
and their wives
 from wearing tartan plaids and other 
sumptuous
 clothing
 while the council of aberdeen
a district by no means highland
 in 
 banned the wearing of plaids 
probably meaning belted plaids
a 
 irish account by lughaidh 
 cl
irigh of scottish gallowglass mercenaries in ireland clearly describes the belted plaid
a mottled garment with numerous colours hanging in folds to the calf of the leg
 with a girdle round the loins over the garment
 the privately organised early 
plantations
colonies
 and later governmental plantation of ulster brought tartan weaving to northern ireland in the late 
th to early 
th centuries
 many of the new settlers were scots
 and they joined the population already well
established there by centuries of gallowglass and other immigrants
 in 
 the earliest surviving piece of irish tartan cloth was discovered in peaty loam just outside dungiven in northern ireland
 in the form of tartan trews
 along with other non
tartan clothing items
 it was dubbed the 
dungiven tartan
 or 
ulster tartan
 the sample was dated using palynology to c
the soil that surrounded the cloth was saturated with pollen from scots pine
 a species imported to ulster from scotland by plantationers
 according to archaeological textile expert audrey henshall
 the cloth was probably woven in county donegal
 ireland
 but the trews tailored in the scottish highlands
 at some expense
 suggesting someone of rank
 possibly a gallowglass
 henshall reproduced the tartan for a 
 exhibit
 it became popular 
and heavily promoted
 as a district tartan for ulster
both in a faded form
 like it was found
 and a bright palette that attempted to reproduce what it may have originally looked like
 and seems to have inspired the later creation of more irish district tartans

 there is nearly nothing in period source material to suggest that the irish also habitually wore tartan

 wear after the irish fashion striped mantles

 of lowland women in edinburgh that
many wear 
especially of the meaner sort
 plaids 
 which is 
sic
 cast over their heads and covers their faces on both sides
 and would reach almost to the ground
 but that they pluck them up
 and wear them cast under their arms
 he also reported that women there wore 
six or seven several habits and fashions
 some for distinction of widows
 wives and maids
 including gowns
 capes
cloaks
 bonnets with bongrace veils
 and collar ruffs
 though he did not address tartan patterns in particular in such garments
while tartan was still made in the highlands as cottage industry
 by 
 production had centred on aberdeen

in greater plenty than 
in
 any other place of the nation whatsoever
 though it was also manufactured in glasgow

s dress was also sometimes simply in linear stripes rather than tartan

 plaids were reduced to smaller

 john macky in a journey through scotland 
 wrote of scottish women wearing
 when about
 such tartan plaids over their heads and bodies
 over english
style dress

 market
 and other functions
 edmund burt
 an englishman who spent years in and around inverness
 wrote in 
published 
 that the women there also wore such plaids
 made of fine worsted wool or even of silk
 that they were sometimes used to cover the head
 and that they were worn long
 to the ankle
 on one side
 he added that in edinburgh 
far to the southeast
 they were also worn
 with ladies indicating their whig or tory political stance by which side they wore long 
though he did not remember which side was which

 perennial disapproval of the 
barbarous habitte
 of women wearing plaids over their heads returned in

union protest and jacobite rebellion
the treaty and acts of union in 
 which did away with the separate parliament of scotland
 led to scottish lowlanders adopting tartan in large numbers for the first time
 as a symbol of protest against the union

regardless of social class
 but even influential edinburgh ladies

proscription and its aftermath
after the failure of the jacobite rising of 
 efforts to pacify the highlands and destroy the cultural and political life of the clans
 led to the dress act 
 part of the act of proscription to disarm the highlanders
 because tartan highland dress was so strongly symbolically linked to the militant jacobite cause
 the act 
 a highly political throwback to the long
abandoned sumptuary laws
 banned the wearing of highland dress by men and boys in scotland north of the river forth 
 in the highlands
aq
 except for the landed gentry
ar
 and the highland regiments of the british army
 the law was based on previous english bans in the 
th century against traditional garb in ireland
 sir walter scott wrote of the dress act
there was knowledge of mankind in the prohibition
 since it divested the highlanders of a dress which was closely in association with their habits of clanship and of war
tartans recorded shortly after the act 
thus probably being patterns in use in the period before proscription
 show that a general pattern was used in a wide area
 with minor changes being made by individual weavers to taste

 the tartan today used as the main

 says that 
the old patterns available are too few in number to permit a detailed study of such pattern distributions
 throughout the highlands
 portraits of the era also show that tartan was increasingly made with identical or near
identical warp and weft patterns
 which had not always been the case earlier
 and that the tartan cloth used was of the fine twill
 with even
warp
and
weft thickness
 still used today for kilts
although the dress act
 contrary to popular later belief
 did not ban all tartan
or bagpipes
 or gaelic
 and women
 noblemen
 and soldiers continued to wear tartan
 it nevertheless effectively severed the everyday tradition of highland scots wearing primarily tartan
 as it imposed the wearing of lowland
 english
like clothing for two generations
while some scotsmen defied the act
 there were stiff criminal penalties
 it had a demoralising effect
as
 and the goal of this and related suppressive measures to integrate the scots into lowland and broader british society
 was largely successful
 by the 
 highland dress seemed all but extinct
 however
 the act may also ironically have helped to 
galvanize clan consciousness

 curtains

infused portraiture of

 dress
 much of it was loyalist regimental military stylings
 the antithesis of jacobite messaging
 it foreshadowed a major shift in the politics of tartan 
see 
 late georgian
 below
 nevertheless
 this profuse application of tartan could be seen as rebellious to some extent
 with the reified highlander becoming 
a heroic and classical figure
 the legatee of primitive virtues
 and by the 
 tartan had become increasingly associated with scotland in general
 not just the highlands

after much outcry 
as the ban applied to jacobites and loyalists alike
 the dress act was repealed in 
 primarily through efforts of the highland society of london
 the repeal bill was introduced by james graham
 marquis of graham 
later duke of montrose
 some highlanders resumed their traditional dress
 but overall it had been abandoned by its former peasant wearers
 taken up instead by the upper and middle classes
 as a fashion
 tartan had been 
culturally relocated as a picturesque ensemble or as the clothing of a hardy and effective fighting force
 for the crown
 not a symbol of direct rebellion
 r
 martin 
 calls this transmutation 
the great bifurcation in tartan dress
 the cloth being largely 
forcibly
 abandoned by the original highland provincials then taken up by the military and consequently by non
highlander civilians
 during the prohibition
 traditional highland techniques of wool spinning and dyeing
 and the weaving of tartan
 had sharply declined
 commercial production of tartan was to become re
centred in the lowlands
 in factory villages along the fringe of the highlands
 among companies like wilsons of bannockburn 
then the dominant manufacturer
 with the rise of demand for tartan for military regimental dress
 some tartan weaving continued in the highlands
 and would even see a boost in the late georgian period
 tartan by this era had also become popular in lowland areas including fife and lothian and the urban centres of edinburgh and stirling
 from 
 to 
 wilsons were exporting large quantities of tartan 
for both men
s and women
s clothing
 first to the british colonies in grenada and jamaica 
where the affordable
 durable
 and bright material was popular for clothing enslaved people
 and had clients in england
 northern and central europe
 and a bit later in north and south america and the mediterranean
 however
 by the end of the 
th century
 wilsons had 
stiff competition
in civilian tartan
 from english weavers in norwich
because the dress act had not applied to the military or gentry
 tartan gradually had become associated with the affluent
 rather than 
noble savage
 highlanders
 from the late 
th century and into the

 martin 
 wrote
 from a historiographical perspective
 that after the dress act
the idea of highland dress was stored in the collective historical attic
 when it was revived in the years leading up to 
 it had been forgotten by some two or three generations in civilian dress and could be remembered
 however deceptively
 however naively
 to have been the ancient dress of the highlands

 but so inimical to a natural historical process
 that it promoted the violent re
assertion of the tartan
 sanctioned by a spurious sense of history
 in the next century
the tumultuous events of

 but two particular enduring tartan categories

 which 
has acquired such a formidable weight from mere reiteration
 without 
critical examination of evidence
 barnes 
 allen 
 observed
there is no doubt that many 
setts
 had been traditional to certain districts for centuries
 but the theory that they were a sort of clan uniform seems now to have been quite discredited
responding to the claim that clan tartans have 
an ancient political significance
 richard martin
 curator of the fashion institute of technology museum and later the costume institute at the metropolitan museum of art
 wrote 
this
 assertion about history is wrong and can be demonstrated to be perniciously wrong
 according to national galleries of scotland curator a
 e
 haswell miller 
to sum up
 the presumed heraldic or 
family badge
 significance of the tartan has no documentary support
 and the establishment of the myth can be accounted for by a happy coincidence of the desire of the potential customers
 the manufacturer and the salesman
 although the antiquity of the 
clan tartans
 is exaggerated
 what might be termed their unofficial registration took place during the nineteenth century
 and if we are prepared to accept some hundred and fifty years as sufficient to create 
tradition
 it may be excusable to accept the fait accompli as a pleasant 
 and perhaps not entirely useless 
 national vanity
highland
dress researcher and curator john telfer dunbar added
the desire to give to relics of all kinds greater antiquity than they truly possess is manifold
 it is a pity that tradition should be degraded in this way and the acceptance of such claims by later students has been a constant obstacle to research
 the more difficult task of searching back to original sources has often been avoided in favour of easy acceptance
just that sort of research was performed by peter eslea macdonald of the scottish tartans authority
 who 
 using every available surviving company record and sample 
 reconstructed and traced the history of tartan patterns from the leading weaver of the late georgian through edwardian eras
 a company instrumental in the actual design
 spread
 and acceptance of clan tartans
 his conclusion
today
 books and shops dealing with highland dress will be mainly
 if not exclusively
 concerned with clan tartans
 they may seek to suggest that these are the actual patterns worn by the scottish clans throughout history
 up to and including the battle of culloden in 
 this is not the case
 the majority of the pre
 patterns bearing clan names can only be traced back to the early 
th century and to the famous weaving firm of william wilson 
 son of bannockburn
 near stirling
the notion of clan tartans has been called 
an astonishingly successful marketing story
 and an example of an invented tradition
 though one that became very well
accepted by the clans to whom it pertained and by the weaving industry starting in 
 as well as by the general public from around 
adopted enthusiastically by both wearer and seller alike
precursors of clan tartans were regionally distinctive tartans 
since at least the early 
th century
 perhaps even the 
th
 regimental uniform tartans 
from 
 onward
 and personal tartans of nobles 
dating to perhaps the mid
th century if not earlier
today
 clan tartans are an important aspect of scottish clans
 and every clan has at least one tartan attributed to its name 
some officially
 some not
 and in a few cases one tartan is shared between multiple clans
 clan tartans may not have actually been traditional
 but they became conventional

john campbell of the bank

 the present official clan campbell tartans are predominantly blue
 green and black
various writers on tartans have supported or opposed the idea of clans long using distinctive tartans as an identifying badge
 interpreting the scarce evidence as suited their viewpoint
aw
 where one saw a militia uniform
 or an individual noble
s plaid
 another saw a clan identifier
 the 
th
century celtic scholar john francis campbell of islay was certain that while tartans in general were quite old
uniform clan tartans are no older than clan regiments
 a view backed by haldane 
 in a series of articles in the scots magazine
 followed by many tartan writers later
the earliest evidence summarised below could have been more a matter of militia uniform than clan
wide dress
 a distinction in that era is difficult to be certain of today
 because troops then were led by landed gentry and a unit was raised largely on its commander
s land from his clansmen
ax
 such definitional uncertainty could also apply to the 
 grameid poem
 describing what appear to be some soldierly uniform tartans
ay
 it could be reinterpreted as supporting an early notion of clan tartans
 if one wanted to define that as 
what most of the men of a clan were wearing into battle
 scarlett 
 confirms that there has been 
fiery argument
 in favour of a clan tartans interpretation
 however
 robert jamieson 
 reported that the 
field dress
 plaids of highland men
 for war and hunting
 were different from their everyday dress 
 made of coarser material and using patterns intended to blend into natural surroundings

war colour

 this casts some doubt on interpretation of militia tartans as general clan tartans
 most of the later regimental uniform tartans 
which did not become adopted as clan tartans until around the early 
th century or the late 
th in a few cases
 when they did at all
 were variations on the dark
 green
based black watch tartan
 as detailed above
 c
 thompson 
 noted 
a typical victorian inclination to cite previous authors with little or no attempt to evaluate their statements 
 modern analysis cannot afford to be so uncritical
 scarlett 
 relatedly observed
wishful proofs are found in profusion in the literature of tartan
 early and late
 and consist of stating an opinion as a fact and adding some more or less relevant historical reference in support
 either implying or stating that this proves the point
 that it proves nothing at all is neither here nor there
 so long as the manner of the presentation is sufficiently authoritative
 given this treatment the wildest theory will be accepted
 copied from one book to the next and so enter tartan lore
 it is almost axiomatic that the wilder the theory the more acceptable it will be 
even d

 stewart 
 who had sometimes been sympathetic toward the idea of clan tartans existing before the 
th century
 wrote
some 
 assure us that the antiquity of the so
called clan patterns is very great
 and many writers allege in general terms that these designs were used as a clan distinction from the earliest period
 the halo of romance surrounding the jacobite struggle inclined many
 and still induces others
 to accept as authentic and reliable
 statements which in different circumstances would be more closely sifted
 thus it is that the tartans 
 have won much favour
 and those who find one represented as bearing their name accept it as their ancient clan pattern without the inconvenience of investigation
 or of posing any awkward questions
the victorians also engaged in some imaginative invention
 aside from the outright forgery of the 
sobieski stewarts
see 
th century broad adoption
 below
 another extreme case is charles rogers
 who in his social life in scotland 
 fantastically claimed that the ancient picts
 figural designs 
 which were painted or tattooed on their bodies
 and they went into battle nude 
 must have been 
denoting the families or septs to which they belonged
 and thus 
this practice originated the tartan of celtic clans
 another asserted that tartan was invented around a thousand years ago by saint margaret of scotland
aside from the unreliability of early writers 
and later copiers of them
 part of the confusion and debate about clan tartans comes down to definitions
 sir thomas innes of learney
 writing in 
 and described as 
immensely keen on 
tartan
 codification and the importance of it
 was one of the firmest proponents of the idea of very old clan tartans 
in the particular sense of 
patterns consistently used for a period by certain clans
 not 
patterns named for certain clans and claimed by them to the present
ba
 he held that some setts gradually became associated with particular families

 over time
 clan territories had mostly become stable by the 
th century

s 
 reference shows various cases of old district tartans later sometimes being identified for a time with specific families before 
th
century adoption of their own

 clan tartans
bb
 innes of learney wrote of clan tartans that 
notwithstanding the unusual 
 case covered below
the tendency was rather to insist upon a similarity of general hue than on similarity of detail
 a vague sense that is not what 
clan tartan
 usually refers to
 he also reasoned that 
it was not until about the 
th century that the clan tartans became conscious and acknowledged badges of identification
 however
 the surviving period source material lacks this 
acknowledgement

 scarlett

 notes that 
had the men of strathspey been accustomed to wearing uniform tartans it would not have been necessary to order them to do so
twice over
 he also observes that the lairds of grant in this period were unusually bent on uniformity
 one of them even issuing moustache regulations for clansmen

 daniel defoe 
 wrote also in considerable detail of highland warriors of the prior century
 and noted that the men were organised into 
companies
 all of a name
 each led by 
one of their own clan or family
 yet he never mentions any distinction between tartans of these different groups
 instead describing them all as wearing tartan with red and yellow over
checks
 strongly implying a regional style
 this pattern of 
th
 through 
th
century writings providing specifics of tartan and highland dress
 but nothing about clan tartans
 is consistent
contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date
 the pattern worn depended not on the wearer
s clan
 but rather regional style and personal taste
 they frequently depict subjects wearing multiple tartans at once
 nor do the tartans shown match current clan tartans
 for example
 the famous painting the macdonald boys playing golf 
 attributed usually to william mosman but sometimes to jeremiah davison
 shows them wearing five different tartans
 and they are not surviving patterns 
except as later reconstructions from the painting
bh
 period tartans were also often of differing warp and weft 
giving more of a striped than checked appearance
 unlike modern symmetrical patterns
 sometimes the portraits were copied
 but with tartans that do not match
 as if the designs were up to artistic whim
 as scarlett 
 put it
hese portraits have one thing in common
 in no case does the tartan shown bear any close resemblance to the modern 
clan
 tartan
 there is a great lack of evidence to show that the pattern of a tartan had any important significance in the early eighteenth century

 the method of identifying highlander friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of the bonnet

 in particular
 the government highland militia forces wore a badge in the form of a black cockade with red saltire
 according to mackay scobie 
each individual wore his own highland dress with varied tartans
 with the only uniform part being the 
hanoverian
 cockade and large coloured cross on the bonnet
 a 
 letter on the scottish troops at culloden describes 
all ye forces as well horse as foot were in highland dress except ye body guards wh
 wore blue bound wth red
 i
 only the bodyguards were wearing a uniform
 and it was not of highland dress
one of many tartan legends has it that the highland
dress ban of the dress act was enacted because tartans were used as clan
identifying symbols or uniforms
 but not a trace of this idea can be found in period sources
 to the contrary
 burt 
 was explicit that english objection to highland dress 
since perhaps 
 was general
 because the garb served to distinguish the highlanders as a people apart from the lowlanders and other british 
not distinguish highlander from highlander
bl
 defoe 
 likewise mocked highland dress as what he saw as a clownish costume that set highlanders apart from everyone else
 not each other
 similarly
 in an account of jacobite trials
 it was asked whether defendants had worn 
highland cloaths
 in general
 with no mention of clan
identifying patterns
 extant macdonald tartan fragments from the battle of culloden do not match each other or any current clan tartan named macdonald
 lord president duncan forbes of culloden
 keen on punishing the jacobites with disarmament and other penalties

mostly con
 regarding the proposed highland
dress ban before parliament passed it

 something that would have been a key argument to address
 c
 p
 lawson 
 raised a point of logic
remembering the continuous clan feuds and the consequent state of more or less perpetual hostilities
 a recognisable clan plaid would have been a positive danger to the wearer outside his own territory
 this may explain why the handful of early apparent examples of groups of men in similar tartan seem to have the nature of militia uniforms and are mentioned in the context of 
fencible
 bodies or outright battle 
possibly aside from the 
 case
bm
 lawson also states
the 
 supplies no evidence that tartans were used as clan insignia 
 relics of those tartans which were worn at culloden or of the pre
 period bear no resemblance to any known modern tartan
 the lord lyon king of arms in 
 sir francis james grant
 wrote that pre
 tartans were qualitatively different from those of the 
th century and later
 scottish united services museum curator dunbar 
 notes this as well
the jacobite poets wrote much about the rousing appeal of highland clans and highland dress
 even tartan specifically
 but never mentioned clan tartans
 similarly
 multiple large volumes of traditional highland folklore were collected and published by john francis campbell in 
 and alexander carmichael 
who also collected tartan samples
 in 
 but they are devoid of any recorded references to clan tartans
despite post
dating the popularisation of the notion among city
dwellers and the upper class
the idea of groups of men wearing the exact same tartan as an identifier is thought to originate 
aside
 again
 from the odd 
 case
 from highland regiment units in the 
th century
 starting with the black watch in 
 according to trevor
roper 
t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans
 for as the highland regiments were multiplied 
 so their tartan uniforms were differentiated
 and when the wearing of tartan by civilians was resumed
 and the romantic movement encouraged the cult of the clan
 the same principle of differentiation was easily transferred from regiment to clan
particular regiments were often dominated by men raised from the same clan lands
 and this may have blurred the line between regimental uniform and clan
identifying tartan
and several tartans of extinct regiments survive today as clan tartans
 newsome 
 writes
the practice of clans wearing these regimental tartans may have in fact been the inspiration for the 
clan tartan
 system as we now know it
 telfer dunbar 
 on the idea of the early independent highland companies using distinct uniform tartans
i feel sure that here we have much of the 
clan tartan
 origin
 the end of the 
th and beginning of the 
th centuries brought an unprecedented level of influence of military clothing styles
 including highland regimental
 on civilian attire 
even for women
 especially among the social elite connected to regiments
 some regimental tartans appear to have been named after their commanding officers
 and this may be how they came to be associated with family
clan names over time
 banks 
 de la chapelle 
the notion of differentiation of tartan by clans might have evolved from this desire to distinguish on highland regiment uniform from another
 certainly
 its classification for military use laid the groundwork for many subsequent designs and the movement toward uniformity
scarlett 
 also observed the connection to regional or 
district
 tartans
asic patterns prevailed over wide areas and were modified by local weavers for their own ends
 it can easily be seen that a local pattern of this kind
 made for a captive clientele
 might have become identified with the people of that locality who were themselves predominantly of one clan or family group and its adherents and
 when the belief grew up that clan tartans had been worn since the beginning of time
 have become
 by retrospection
 the clan tartan of that group
 there is no evidence that the highlanders themselves looked on tartan in that light

we can 
 readily accept that certain dyes would prevail in different regions and that traditional types of pattern might be followed in various parts
 martin martin in 
 had described tartans as being identifiably specific to particular regions
 but not clans
 there are numerous cases of tartans loosely associated with districts later becoming clan tartans
 the best
documented case
 is the tullibardine pattern
 one of the few modern clan tartans that can be traced 
at all
 not as a clan tartan
 to the pre
proscription period
 it was long associated with perthshire
 and later adopted as the murray of tullibardine clan tartan
 but sold by wilsons as simply 
tullibardine
 as late as c
 and it was found for sale in a market by w
 a
 smith around 
 who also said it was worn then by charles murray
 earl of dunmore
 the first record of the pattern as 
murray of tullibardine
 is in their 
 book
 it appears in at least five early portraits
 four date to c
 the first of an unknown female sitter attributed to cosmo alexander
bn
 and three by allan ramsay 
with the cloth painting completed by joseph van aken
 which are not of any known murrays 
but of a campbell
 a macleod
 and a macdonald
 it is not until 
 that a known murray is painted wearing it 
john murray
 earl of dunmore
 by joshua reynolds
 which still does not necessarily make it a 
clan tartan
 at that early a date 
evidence for its historic use by that branch 
of clan murray
 is circumstantial at best
 the oldest version of it differs slightly as to colours and sett from the modern clan version
bo
similarly
 according to the scottish register of tartans
 the district tartan for huntly
 originating in more complex form as the personal tartan of a marchioness of huntly
probably henrietta mordaunt
 was in use as a regional tartan since at least 
the 
 and worn at culloden by clansmen of brodie
 forbes

district

this advertisement
 it may be urged
 is a stumbling
block in the way of those who argue for the antiquity of clan patterns
 for it seems peculiar that
 when the city was filled with highlanders of all ranks and many clans
 they should be offered not their ancient setts 
 other advertisements for tartan from 
 to the early 
th century did not mention clans
 or focus on the patterns at all
 but rather on the forms in which the cloth could be ordered
 even immediately after the repeal of the dress act in 
 the demand was for 
latest patterns and bright colours
 with no hint of a family heraldry aspect
william wilson 
 son of bannockburn
 just south of the dividing line between the highlands and lowlands
 were the first large
scale commercial tartan producers
 founded c
 they had become the foremost supplier of tartan to the military by around 
 and the dominant tartan weaver in general
 it was an endeavor that required the introduction of tartan recording
 of standardisation of setts and dyes
 and of consistency and quality control
 wilsons corresponded with their agents 
especially the son
 james wilson
 in the highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the various districts to enable them to reproduce 
perfectly genuine patterns

 setts in addition to ones they designed in

 can be traced to this work 
 just often originally with numbers or unrelated names

 eslea macdonald

some of the

 others were altered or were the basis for a number of variations which were named or simply numbered 
 whatever their origins
 these patterns gave rise to the idea of clan tartans as we know them today

s origins may have indeed been a lot older than the 
 kpb but their contemporary names were almost always the work of wilsons or subsequent writers

 by lt

 sir william cockburn

probably naming them after prominent individuals

another of the tartan legends has it that alexander gordon

 then passed the other two on to cadet branches of the family

th century broad adoption
it has been suggested by a modern chief of clan campbell and another of the clan executives that the clan had informally adopted what is now known as old campbell or black watch tartan by the early 
th century
 because so many of their men were already wearing it as part of regimental uniform
three of the independent highland companies that amalgamated into the black watch regiment in 
 were campbell units
 some time in or after 
 when he became clan chief
 the city
dwelling politician george campbell
th duke of argyll
 created his own personal tartan
 of black watch with a thin over
check of white and yellow added
to differentiate himself from the rest of the campbells

boosting effect
 including the invention of new clan
specific tartans to suit
or renaming of old tartans to have clan names
 as clan chiefs had been asked to attend in clan tartans
 it caused a boom in the tartan
weaving business
 and a broader public notion that tartans should be named for families

 at this moment ignorantly disputing for the right to the same tartans which in fact belong to none of them but are merely modern inventions for clothing regimental highlanders
 scott himself was backpedalling away from what he had helped create
 and was suspicious of the recent claims about 
ancient
 clan tartans
it has been the bane of scottish literature and disgrace of her antiquities
 that we have manifested an eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors which we adopt too hastily ourselves

along with other lowland family tartans
 by walter scott
 but remains the most popular scott tartan
a wave of highly dubious books were published
 all purporting to reveal true clan histories and tartans
 they presented little in the way of evidence
 but they caused enthusiastic adoption of clan tartans
 the first of these
 in 
 was the scottish ga
l or celtic manners
 as preserved among the highlanders by james logan
 containing 
 tartans 
based on wilsons
 collection
 that of the highland society of london
 and other sources he alleged but did not name
 plus some he collected or devised himself
 the author ignored advice from wilsons on which were actually old tartans
 and included some erroneous
 fictitious
 and incomplete setts
bx
 he also included untenable assertions about the designs
 antiquity
logan took the line that everything highland was rooted impossibly far in the past
 and was mocked in the pall mall gazette for it
 meanwhile
 wilsons and other weavers simply adopted some patterns from his book due to demand
 and also took to inventing all
new 
clan tartans
 to keep up with the growing market for patterns associated with names
 the archived correspondence of wilsons in the 
s shows that the company was frequently pressured by merchants for the 
truest
 and 
real
 clan patterns
 logan
 despite himself being involved in sham clan tartanry
 observed that 
fanciful varieties of tartan 
 were being passed off as genuine
 by wilsons and other weavers
logan was followed in 
 by vestiarium scoticum by the so
called sobieski stuarts
 purporting to contain 
 centuries
old clan tartans
 illustrated in great detail but from vague textual descriptions
 although it is now known to have been largely a forgery
by
 many of the visual tartan designs in this 
final 
 and fantastic 
 codification
 of clan tartans were nevertheless adopted and still survive as accepted tartans of clans
 especially for lowland clan names 
which had hitherto never been associated with tartan or highland garb at all
 starting in 
 borders families had been redefining themselves as clans
 and the book encouraged more of them to take on clan tartans and open clan societies
 modern critics have even praised the lasting socio
cultural accomplishement of the sobieski
stuarts
 works in helping establish a systemic clan
tartans legend while recognizing the bogus nature of their material

the socio
political background of these events and their overall impact on tartan in general are presented at

trevor
roper 
 believed that the sobieski stuarts had been in direct communication with manufacturers like wilsons
 and were advising clan chiefs on which tartans to choose
 from as early as 
 j
 c
 thompson 
 agreed
 dick lauder certainly said they were doing so by 
 and that wilsons were already weaving many sobieski stuart samples by that year
 the company
s own records the same year confirm orders for designs from the sobieski stuarts
 vestiarium was followed soon after by the costume of the clans published by the sobieski stuarts in 
 the illustrations it provided
 allegedly based on portraits
 have proven to be largely a mixture of error and invention
 by 
 john sobieski stuart was in discussion with a publisher to produce a new
 cheaper edition of vestiarium
 in a series of small volumes 
so that it might be rendered as available as possible to manufacturers and the trades in general concerned in tartan 
 and it was for the
ir
 advantage and use 
 that i consented to the publication
 the same letter also proposed binding the manufacturers by contract to produce tartans that conformed exactly to the sobieski stuarts
 specifications
weavers like wilsons were complicit
 not passive
 in the tartan boom
 they had lost much of their military and export markets after major wars ended and colonies in the americas and elsewhere had become more self
sufficient
the concept of differentiated clan tartans
 newly popularized
 was codified and developed by canny manufacturers 
 since the repeal of the 
dress act
 these tartan makers saw the prospect of a vast new market
 according to alastair campbell of airds
one factor which has been decisive throughout the history of the development of the modern system 
of clan tartans
 has been the influence of the tartan manufacturers 
 as with any marketing organisation it was important to maintain a steady flow of 
new products
 and every year new patterns were produced 
 the idea of individual tartans providing a clan or family identity was a most attractive one
 which was adopted enthusiastically by both wearer and seller alike

 they also simultaneously increased the number of clans with their own assigned tartans
 and reduced the number of tartans claimed to be those of certain clans to a more manageable number
 probably after consultation with clan chiefs and clan society officers
 they did
 however
 typically include sept lists
 which today are widely regarded as bogus
though many present
day clan associations still use them
 as a means of attracting larger membership
almost every extant clan 
with or without a chief
 had at least one tartan associated with it by this era

accepted tartans

 of clan tartans has varied widely
 and still does today
 although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and assign it any name they wish
 the only person with the authority to make a clan

official
 is the chief
some clans have had no chiefs for some time
 while only a majority subset of those with living chiefs in the modern era made direct proclamations as to their clan tartans and registered them with the lord lyon

 which he blamed on 
indiscriminate commercialisation 
 disingenuous and lead

 the highland romantic revival
 inspired by james macpherson
s 
ossian
 poems and the writings of sir walter scott
 led to wider interest in tartan and other things felt to be gaelic and celtic
 clubs like the celtic societies welcomed lowlanders
 and tartan was rapidly appropriated
 as part of the scottish national identity
and part of broader british dress as a familiar exoticism

ch
 while tartan had already seen more nationwide use from 
 as a scottish nationalism symbol against union with england
 it was turned on its ear to become a romanticised symbol of union loyalism in the early 
th century
 an era in which prominent conflicts caused a patriotic influence of military 
including highland
 style on civilian clothing
ci
 even among women
 despite its overtly masculine focus
 first among the northern gentry and later among the common people more broadly
 there was a renewed interest in tartan and highland dress
 despite the long period of prohibition 
 largely due to the glory associated with the highland regiments
 exemplary service in various military campaigns
highlandism
 became a romantic
 mythologised 
even fictionalised
 and colourful escapism
 even as lowland scotland itself was becoming one of the most industrialised places on earth
 and the entire nation was undergoing the social upheavals of union and empire
 of large
scale warfare
 of urbanisation
 and of modernisation during the scottish enlightenment
 the bloody french revolution of 
 had also helped inspire a british setting aside of old stuart and hanoverian rivalry
before the clan tartans rush began in 
 tartan was already being aggressively marketed to the general public as 
fancy
 cloth with names that commemorated famous events and people
 even fictional characters from books and songs

the popularity of tartan was greatly increased by the royal visit of king george iv of the united kingdom to edinburgh in 
 with other nobles including lord mayor of london sir william curtis
 in highland garb
 george was the first reigning monarch to visit scotland in 
 years

 which was nicknamed

law and biographer john gibson lockhart called a 
celtic hallucination
 thousands of spectators attended the many events arranged for the visit
 the formal ball

 and some 
 tailors were employed to supply it
the royal endorsement of tartan and highland
wear did much to erase any lingering association of them with the servile peasant class of the highlands
or the region
s bands of mountain bandits
 for that matter
 because scott had become 
the acknowledged preserver of scotland
s past
 through his historical novels

 a large public tartan affair was the 
 atholl gathering

 after a period of abeyance
 continues to the present
 from the end of proscription through the georgian promotion
distrust of the highlands became fascination
 and tartan and highland garb 
moved from the periphery to the very center
 accompanied by all the processes of forgetting and imaginative re
creation
 tartan
 no longer the everyday traditional dress of highland 
barbarians
 had become
 in altered form
 all the rage among the scottish upper and even middle classes as formal attire
 this popularisation of tartan increased its marketability in the lowlands
 in england
 and in the colonies
 and provided a boost to the scottish textile industry

 tartan was in vogue in paris in particular in this period
 and approximations of highland soldiers even appeared in parisian plays at the time
 tartans associated with family names became popular
 but there was also a brisk trade in new tartans commissioned for societies
 to commemorate events
 in honour of famous persons
 and designed simply to personal aesthetic taste
 manufacturers struggled to keep up with demand
 by 
 dominant tartan weaver wilsons of bannockburn
also a carpet and ribbon weaver
 was keenly interested in exploiting the civilian market
 due to a reduction in regimental demand
 and introduced many more patterns

 looms

fold increase in output in 
 leading up to george iv

 after which they acquired 
 more looms

 named the royal george after the king
 and expanded into a new mill in 
 mechanising more and more to keep up with demand
 they stopped weaving muslin to focus on tartan
 and produced it in a range of qualities from finest merino wool to cheap linsey
woolsey blends
 demonstrating that whatever high
class associations tartan had taken on
 there was significant working
class demand
 in 
 a merchant wrote to wilsons that 
we are like to be torn to pieces for tartan
 the demand is so great we cannot supply our customers
 and there was great demand for the newest patterns

georgian and later victorian entrepreneurs not only created new tartans
 but new tartan objects called tartanware
 starting as far back as the proscription period in the form of wine glasses decorated with tartan and enamel jacobite portraits
 tartan decorated an assortment of common household objects
 such as snuffboxes
 jewellery cases
 tableware
 sewing accessories
 desk items
 and even doorknobs and furniture 
 a tartan knick
knack market for tourists that continues through the present in the highlands
 visitors to the highlands went home with tartanware
 and scotland
based businesses sent tartanware out as gifts to customers
 some of the more popular tartans used were the stewart

 macgregor
 macduff
 macbeth
 and one fancifully named

 tartanware is widely collected in england and scotland

vestiarium scoticum
the first publication showing colour plates of an array of tartans was the vestiarium scoticum 
meaning 
wardrobe of the scots
 published in 
 and it included a first
 tartans for lowland families
 it was the work of two brothers
 john carter allen and charles manning allen
 from surrey
 england
 who used a variety of assumed names
 the two implied they were grandsons of prince charles edward stuart and princess louise of stolberg
gedern
 and consequently later became known as the 
sobieski stuarts
 they claimed further that the vestiarium was based on a 
 manuscript on clan tartans 
 a manuscript which they never managed to produce
 it was not known at the time
 but many of the tartans were simply invented by the brothers
 and others were taken from early
th
century sources like the cockburn and wilson collections
 the brothers heavily favoured basic checks
 or crudely divided checks
 with thin over
checks added
 they had an identifiable style of tartans
 assessment of which has varied from 
few can be called inspired
 to 
quite novel and singularly gorgeous
 the vestiarium was followed by their equally dubious the costume of the clans in 
 the books
 which 
added mystery
 romance and some spurious historical documentation to the subject
 triggered another wave of interest in tartans
 and the enthusiasm generated by these publications led the way for numerous tartan books in the later 
th century

 they even decorated their carriage with tartan
 their adoption of a showy form of highland dress inspired adoption by subject 
who would have previously left highland dress to the festivals of the scots
the royal couple spent a considerable amount of time at their scottish estate 
nearly 
 years in total
cm
 and in doing so hosted 
highland
 activities
 victoria was attended by pipers
 and her children were attired in highland dress
 prince albert himself loved watching the highland games
 and the pair became patrons of the braemar gathering
support from and attendance by various nobles may have helped preserve such events to the present
 but it also 
tartanised
 them permanently
 all the way into the 
st century
 the royal enthusiasm for and patronage of highland things generated more early tourism to the highlands
cn
 and a boost to business in the region as far as perth and edinburgh
 it also spread tartan
wearing to other northern british lords and ladies
 who began to invent complicated etiquette rules of dress for highland garb
 which had the effect of increasing the sense that it was upper
class attire
see

 adoption of tartan continued to spread into england
 thomas osborne
 duke of leeds
 in west yorkshire
 devised a livery tartan for his men in 
 tartan
 though a 
pseudo
caledonian masquerade
 had become 
the stuff of loyalty to the crown
 with 
a spurious royal and aristocratic cachet
 this royal promotion was also noted abroad
 with the effect that tartan became one of the widest
recognised cultural
identity symbols for the entire british country
despite their considerable devotion to charity 
up to 
 of their privy purse income
 victoria and albert
 along with their friends in the northern gentry
 have been accused of using their 
balmorality
 a term coined by george scott
moncrieff 
 to refer to upper
class appropriation of highland cultural trappings
 marked by 
hypocrisy
 and 
false sentiment
 to trivialise and even fictionalise history
 according to fiona k
 armstrong 
 they engaged in long
term
 tartan
blanketed escapism from the uncertainties of modernising
 industrialised society and from pressing british societal problems
 while worsening those problems in the actual highlands
 the queen
s balmoral residency also had a colonising effect
 leading other english nobility to follow her north and buy property
 resulting in land
ownership disparities that persist to the present

as the tartan and 
romantic highlands
 craze swept over scotland
 the real highland population suffered grievously from the hungry forties as well as the highland clearances
 when thousands of gaelic
speaking scots from the highlands and isles were evicted by landlords 
often the very men who would have been their clan chiefs
 to make way for sheep
 and for expansive deer
hunting preserves
 scots were also largely disenfranchised from voting
 and the highlands were running out of young men
 in great regimental demand to fight and die in foreign wars for the empire
 and many emigrating otherwise
 with victoria and albert directly patronising emigration societies
 nearly 
 million scots moved to non
european destinations during the victorian era 
more than half the native
born scottish people of the period
 and took a measure of highlandism with them
many of the generally understood images of the highlands were held to be 
real
 by people at the time
 this would have strong tartan
promoting results among the scottish diaspora later

 calls it a 
tartan hunger that has been abroad from late victorian times to the present day

thomas babington macaulay wrote in 
 of the romantic reinvention of highland customs as somehow generally scottish

 that
 by most englishmen
 scotchman and highlander were regarded as synonymous words

 sir john graham dalyell asserted that 
forty years ago no reputable gentleman would have appeared in a kilt in the streets of edinburgh

 likewise wrote of tartans being 
misconceived
 and worn all over scotland 
and even england
 in the victorian era as a part of the queen
s influence
 increasingly
urban scotland was putting on a 
rural face
a trend that would continue with 
kailyard
 literature
 tartanry and highlandism were popular in part as a counter to a sense 
especially among the aristocracy
 that scotland was losing its separate national identity in the georgian to victorian era
 being ever more anglicised as just

 ian brown 
 a professor with a focus on scottish literature and culture
 has written that while george iv and victoria 
not to mention business interests in their wake
 like the wilsons of bannockburn and the smiths of mauchline
 seemed to have been 
the winner taking over the loser
s tokens
 the renewed public interest in tartan within and beyond scotland was not entirely owing to them
 especially given the international interest in highland
romantic works of walter scott and 
ossian
 the acceptance of and even enthusiasm for tartan among the post
proscription upper class can be seen as a necessary attempt at reconciliation within a culturally diverse country
 and the influence ran both ways
 with old scottish nationalism transmuting into a new unionism that demanded recognition of scottish interests and institutions
in short
 it is an open question whether george iv in a kilt and victoria and albert at balmoral are appropriating and subverting a set of values
 or whether they are being appropriated and subverted

 the resulting book is the most detailed record of the

 which 
removed tartan from its blustery nonchalance to an ordered set of adornments
 most of which survive to the present

in scotland indeed the plaid has still some importance
 but it is an object of manufacture

 gordon teall of teallach
 of the scottish tartans society
 observed in 
tartans have always formed part of scotland
s historic heritage and it is a compliment to their country that they have become so widespread throughout the english and gaelic speaking world
 they are probably more popular now than they have ever been because they have come to symbolise the spirit of families
 clans and districts and
 more recently
 corporate institutions

 as 
the most straightforward and outward sign of 
 affinity with scottishness
 and bent to the commercial intents of fashion
 tourism
 entertainment
 and other industries
 tartan
s reception by native scots in scotland has been less favourable for decades
 even the last century or so
 reasons include a feeling that it is not really a symbol of broad scottish national identity because of its specifically gaelic and highland origin
 the 
highlandist
 and imperialist foisting of it on the entire country as national costume in the late georgian through victorian eras
 distorted views of scottish people promulgated by lauder and other tartaned entertainers of a century ago

brow

 scotland

 that the national archives of scotland would set up a national register of tartans

tartan
s importance to scotland cannot be overestimated
 it is deeply embedded in scottish culture and is an internationally recognised symbol of scotland
 this was later reiterated in 
 through the bbc

the tartan industry is a significant contributor to the overall scottish economy
 and larger 
 than suggested by previous industry estimates

 businesses

popular designs
one of the most popular tartans is the royal stewart
 ostensibly the personal tartan of the british monarch
 since george iv declared it his own 
though it was probably designed by the sobieski stuarts
 albeit based on mid
th
century pattern called 
prince charles edward stuart
 the 
royal
 sett was first published in 
 in the book the scottish ga
l by james logan
 in addition to its use in clothing
 such as skirts and scarves
 royal stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for scottish shortbread
 and it has also long been favoured by the british punk scene
another tartan in very common use by the general public is black watch 
also known as old campbell
 grant hunting
 and government
 this tartan
 a dark variant 
and ancestor
 of the main clan campbell tartan
 has long been used by military units in the british army and other commonwealth forces
early manufacturer wilsons of bannockburn made many 
fashion

 or 
national
 tartans with catalogue numbers or fanciful names
 without any association with particular families
 districts
 or organisations
 two popular ones still in use are both usually called 
caledonia
 wilsons no
 is found in their 
 key pattern book and is comparatively simple
 while no

 though of a similar colour scheme

 various patterns are technically tartan but are not treated as tartans in the clan or district sense
 the very basic red
and
black rob roy or robert roy macgregor pattern
 the oldest of the clan gregor setts 
though named after rob roy in the victorian period
 is also in broad use 
often with changed colours
 as one of the most common patterns used in flannel cloth for clothing and bedding
 in the us
 it is often called 
buffalo plaid
 a term of uncertain derivation
 when the rob roy sett is changed to a white ground with any other colour this forms the most common gingham cloth style
 gingham is often given a wider setting
 to form a lattice appearance 
sometimes called 
windowpane plaid
 or 
windowpane check
 when that pattern is given one or more additional over
check colours
 the result is the pattern known as tattersall
one of the most common flannel patterns
buffalo plaid
 is just rob roy macgregor tartan 
originally red and black
 rendered in any of various colours

 they have even been created for particular religious and ethnic groups

 tartan has had a long history with the military
 and today some military units 
 particularly those within the commonwealth 
 have tartan dress uniforms

 uk military or government tartans

many districts
 cities
 and towns in scotland have their own tartans
 mostly dating to the 
th century 
though some few district tartans are quite old
cp
 and not always official
 many were just created for marketing to tourists
 and some are copyrighted works tied to specific vendors
 they are intended primarily for those to whom a clan tartan does not seem to apply 
see 
 etiquette

 at least two local government councils in scotland have official tartans
a tartan with wide bands of green and red
 and narrower bands of grey and yellow
the maple leaf tartan
 designed in 
 has been an official symbol of canada since 
in addition to the traditional district and modern geographic tartans of scotland
 new designs have been created for places in other countries
 only some regional tartans are officially recognised by the government bodies of the places the designs represent
the pan
celticism movement has inspired the creation of 
national
in the sense of celtic nations
 and sometimes regional tartans 
to emphasise the 
 bonds with other celtic countries

 generally based on established scottish tartans with some colour changes
 these geographical tartans
 which 
aside from the dungiven
ulster reconstruction of 
 date to 
 and later
 do not have any official recognition
 and are purely a product of the industry
 one weaver even introduced a competing set of irish national and county tartans in 
 different from the previous offerings

 would appear to be minimal

tartans have been created for australia
 its capital city
 canberra
 each of its states

 us states have official tartans
 with the first dating from 
hunting
 mourning
 dress
 and dance
highland dancing
 at a 
 highland games event
 in aboyne dresses with dance tartans that feature a lot of white
a tartan is sometimes differentiated from another with the same name by a label
 hunting
 mourning
 dress
 or dance
 the first three of these ideas are the result of victorian fondness for dress etiquette and show
and weaver marketing
 the last is more recent
hunting tartans tend to be made up of subdued colours
 such as dark blues
 greens
 and browns
 although there is some evidence of early tartans with camouflage colours going back to the 
th century
 hunting tartans
 despite the name
 have very little to do with actual hunting
mourning tartans
 though quite rare
 are associated with death and funerals
 they are usually designed using combinations of black and white
 or by replacing bright colours such as reds and yellows in a traditional tartan with black
 white
 or grey
dress tartans are usually special tartans for formal
dress occasions
 dress stewart
 is distinct from both the main royal stewart tartan and the hunting stewart
 among several other tartans attributed to stewart
stuart
 in a few cases
 a dress tartan is simply the main tartan of the clan
cw
 dress tartans that do differ from main clan tartans are sometimes entirely different 
 macmillan
 and macmillan dress
 are unrelated designs
 while in most cases they are based on the main tartan but with colour differences 
 stewart
 some dress tartans are very modern
 but some date back to the era of the vestiarium scoticum
dance tartans
 intended for highland dance outfits
 for either sex
 are inspired 
like most dress tartans before them
 by the arisaid 
earasaid tartans thought to have been worn by highland women in the 
th and 
th centuries
 which often featured white as a major colour
 as do typical dance tartans today 
most or all of which date to the 
th century or later
 some dance tartans are named 
arisaid
 rather than 
dance
 e
 fraser arisaid
cx
there has been some confusion between dress and dance tartans
 especially since the idea of the latter developed from the former
cy
 most dress tartans
 including some of the oldest
 also have white in them
 and have been used for dance competition in lieu of a dance
specific tartan
 so are easy to mistake for dance tartans
 which almost invariably have white in them
cz
family and individual
a large proportion of non
clan tartans in all of the modern tartan databases have always been family tartans
 promulgated mostly from the late 
th century for family names that are not clans or listed as septs of clans
 these are usually scottish surnames
 but the scottish register of tartans 
srt
 database increasingly includes new family tartans for names that are not scottish or even british
 most family tartans have no copyright claim
 since they are intended for use by anyone with the surname or an extended
family connection
 the srt classifies them together with clan tartans in a 
clan
family
 category if they have history that pre
dates srt or if they are newer and are approved by a legally recognized clan chief or family head
 but in a 
name
 category if they are newer and lack such imprimatur

 some clans recognise tartans for specific family branches and septs that are not themselves generally regarded as clans
 for example

duncan acknowledges separate
 established tartans 
some of them quite old
 for inches
 macglashan
 macinroy
 maclagan
 macphee
 macwilliam
 reid
 and robinson
 and they are all registered in the srt
since the late 
 various weavers have marketed 
primarily to irish americans
 some tartans with irish family names
 without any involvement by family members
 there had also been a legend that the rare clans originaux 
 contained irish family tartans
 but this was finally disproven in 
db
 there is one case of a formal irish clan
family tartan
 however
 the clan cian society commissioned a tartan for cian of ely
 and registered it with the chief herald of ireland in 
even this has an irish
american connection
 as the chief resided in california
 and the society is us
headquartered
 similarly
 a commercial operation in cardiff named wales tartan centre 
supplied by cambrian woollen mill
 has since the early 
s promoted a long series of tartans named for common or prominent welsh family names
 they are unusual in often having odd
numbered thread counts
 and having a different warp and weft 
producing rectangular rather than square patterns
 probably to distinguish them from the scottish style
for the much narrower sense of family
 the srt registers also as 
name
 tartans those that are created by individuals for only themselves and their immediate
family members
 often for weddings
 these usually have a copyright claim
 one of the earliest tartans named for a specific person
dc
 is the 
janet wilson sett

 though made as one of their publicly available patterns

corporate and commercial
numerous scottish brands use tartan
 and some have unique tartans
 various not
for
profit organisations also have corporate tartans
 probably the earliest case was that of the ancient caledonian society of london 
founded in

 which used what is believed to have been a consistent tartan
 for its members

which
 unusually
 featured brocade woven into the tartan

the naming and registration of 
official
 clan tartans began in 
 when the highland society of london solicited clan tartans from clan chiefs
following recognition by a clan chief of a tartan as a clan tartan
 the chief was formerly able to petition the lord lyon king of arms
 the scottish heraldic authority
 to register it as a formal clan tartan
de
 once approved by the lord lyon
 after recommendation by the advisory committee on tartan
 the clan tartan was then recorded in the lyon court books
 however
 leading up to the launch of the scottish register of tartans in 
see below for details
 the office of the lord lyon stopped providing this tartan
recording process 
though its statutory authority was not changed by the tartans bill
modern
day tartans can be created and registered by anyone
 with the scottish register of tartans
 modern registered tartans include ones for scottish and other districts
 cities
 and towns
 for irish counties 
devised since the 
 and families 
for example
 the surname fitzpatrick has two registered tartans
 for organisations and companies
 and even for specific events or individuals
 tartans are also being created in record numbers among the scottish diaspora in the united states
 canada
 australia
 new zealand
 etc
 especially for places
 military divisions
 pipe bands
 and individuals and their immediate families
until the late 
th century
 instead of a central official tartan registry
 independent organisations located in scotland
 canada
 and the united states documented and recorded tartans
 in 
 an organisation called the scottish tartans society 
now defunct
 and originally named scottish tartans information centre
 was created to record and preserve every known tartan design
 the society
s register of all publicly known tartans 
rapkt
 contained about 
 different designs of tartan
 registration of new designs was not free of charge
 the society
 however
 ran into financial troubles in 
 and folded
former members of that society formed two new scotland
based entities 
 the scottish tartans authority 
sta
 before sts closed
 and the scottish tartans world register 
stwr
 the trade name of a private company
 tartan registration ltd
 both of these organisations initially based their databases on the rapkt
 sta
s database
 the international tartan index 
iti
 consisted of about 
 different tartans 
with over 
 counting variants
 as of 
 the online iti was later rebranded the tartan ferret
 stwr
s self
titled scottish tartans world register database was made up of about 
 different designs as of 
 both organisations were registered as scottish charities and recorded new tartans 
free in the case of sta and for a fee in the case of stwr
 on request
in the interim
 a jointly scotland
 and us
based organisation
 international association of tartan studies and tartan educational 
 cultural association 
iats
teca
 emerged in 
 and published its own tartanart database in the early 
s as microsoft windows software which was much used in the north american kilt
making trade
 iats
teca was absorbed by sta by 
the scottish register of tartans 
srt
 is scotland
s official tartan register
 and was established in 
 srt is maintained and administered by the national archives of scotland 
nas
 a statutory body based in edinburgh
 the aim of the register is to provide a definitive and accessible resource to promote and preserve tartans
 it is also intended to be the definitive source for the registration of new tartans 
if they pass criteria for inclusion and a registration fee is paid
 the database itself 
 also named simply scottish register of tartans
 and sometimes called tartanregister from its domain name 
 is made up of the pre
existing registers of sta and stwr as they were at the time of srt
s launch 
preserving the sta

 and other details in the srt data
 plus new registrations from 
 february 
 onward

 users can register new tartans
 search for existing tartans and request their thread counts
 and receive notifications of newly registered tartans
stwr became defunct some time after 
 sta later closed the iti
tartan ferret to new registrations
 and in late 
 removed the search feature from the sta website 
pending a site redesign
 deferring to the scottish register of tartans
 which now appears to be the only operating tartan registry
 sta continues offline work on the iti database

 etc
legal protection
some modern tartans are protected by trademark law
 and the trademark proprietor can
 in certain circumstances
 prevent others from selling that tartan
 an example is the 
burberry check
 of the english fashion house
 an instantly recognisable tartan that is very well known around the world
df
unlike trademark registration and copyright registration
 the scottish register of tartans 
srt
 and its authorising tartans bill do not create any new or enhanced intellectual property rights through the act of registration 
nor provide any enforcement mechanism other than removal of infringing entries from the registry
srt
 however
 permits registrants optionally to assert and record copyright and
or trademark claims over their new tartans
 for designs that are eligible for such protection under other established law
such as the copyright
 designs and patents act 
 and the scotland act 
 which took over copyright and trademark registration and enforcement in scotland
 and lists such tartans as restricted
 an srt registration 
provides evidence of the existence and date of 
the
 design
 which helps establish the copyright date under the berne copyright convention
 such legal protections apply only to comparatively recently created tartans
 old clan
 regimental
 and district tartans are outside the protection periods of such intellectual property laws
srt also permits the listing of intended use and manufacture restriction preferences
 but has no enforcement capability
 and also includes a statement that 
no other rights can be conferred
 british tartan weavers
 such as lochcarron and d
 c
 dalgliesh
 generally will not produce material in an srt 
restricted
 tartan without written evidence of permission from the copyright
trademark claimant
 in additional furtherance of intellectual property concerns
 the srt also refuses to register a new tartan that is confusingly similar to any existing one 
as determined by an srt review process
the application of copyright law to tartans is not well tested
 the leading british legal case on textile copyright
 concerned with designs printed on fabric
 is designer guild ltd v russell williams 
textiles
 ltd 
 finding for fairly broad copyright protection in textile works that involve creative originality
 in 
 two tartan pattern copyright holders
 rosemary nicolson samios and weaver lochcarron of scotland
 took legal action for infringement of an isle of skye district sett 
designed 
 and the princess diana memorial sett 
designed 
 respectively
 against the gold brothers firm of surinder
 galab
 malap
 and dildar singh
 who operate dozens of stores in scotland and online that sell primarily chinese
made tartan objects or 
tartan
tat
 including cheap highland
dress outfits
 for the tourist market
 the isle of skye tartan was considerably profitable for samios
 after the pattern was popularised by queen elizabeth ii wearing it in 
 the princess diana sett was designed by alistair buchan of lochcanrron and of the scottish tartans authority as a charity fundraiser
 a british court on 
 july 
 issued an interim interdict 
preliminary injunction
 against gold brothers
 sale of isle of skye goods
 after a police search found hundreds of metres of the pattern in chinese
made cloth in the company
s warehouse
 both cases may have been settled out
of
court because published news regarding them ceases in 
 a more recent case
 abraham moon 
 sons ltd v
 thornber 
 others 
 actually involved tartan
 it held that the textual ticket stamp 
a detailed set of weaving instructions
 i
 a thread count with additional information on precise colours
 etc
 used to produce a tartan designed in
house by the claimant had been infringed
 was protected as a literary work
 and also constituted a 
recording
 of the graphical work of the tartan and thus was independently protected as a work of artistic craftsmanship
 as of 
 the decision was being appealed
 as it conflicted with previous caselaw
 e
 hensher v restawile 
 holding such instructions to be uncopyrightable
while tartan arguably could be classified as a form of intangible cultural heritage
 and its value to identifying scottish products both in scotland and internationally has been recognised and exploited for a long time
 tartan is not protected by either geographical indication 
protected designation of origin
 law
 nor sui generis legislation specific to that kind of product
 harris tweed
 another textile associated more narrowly with scotland
 does have such protection
 in 
 keith lumsden
 research officer of the scottish tartans society
 proposed that the word tartan be prohibited for use to market a textile
 unless the design was accepted in an official governmental tartan registry 
which did not then exist
 when the scottish parliament finally authorised the scottish register of tartans in 
 it did not include anything like this sort of trade protection
 according to michael b
 paterson 
no mechanism exists to protect 
traditional scottish
 tartan from 
misuse
 by interests having nothing to do with scotland or scotland
s interests
 though the tartan registries 
play an important
 if weak
 role in asserting scotland
s cultural rights in relation to tartan
etiquette

 when knighted by queen elizabeth ii in 
 he wore this green

s clan maclean
since the victorian era
 authorities on tartan have claimed that there is an etiquette to wearing tartan
 specifically tartan attributed to clans or families
 in the same line of opinion
 some tartans attributed to the british royal family have been claimed to be 
off limits
 to non
royalty
 even so
 there are no laws or universally accepted rules on who can or cannot wear a particular tartan
 the concept of the entitlement to certain tartans has led to the term universal tartan
 or free tartan
 which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone
 traditional examples of such are the black watch
 caledonia
 hunting stewart
 and jacobite tartans
 shepherds
 check
 and district tartans
 the published marketing of tartans for simple fashion purposes without any association to a place or body dates back to at least 
 and much of wilsons
 output through the 
th century consisted of 
fancy
 patterns for the general public
 some recently created designs intended for everyone 
though some are exclusive to particular weavers or highland dress outfitters
 have names including braveheart
 clansman
 european union
 highlander
 independence
 pride of scotland
 rainbow
 scotland 
 scotland the brave
 scottish national
 scottish parliament
 spirit of scotland
 stone of destiny
 and twenty first century
books on scottish clans list such rules and guidelines
 one such opinion is that people not bearing a clan surname
 or surname claimed as a sept of a clan
 should not wear the tartan of their mother
s clan
 this opinion is reinforced by the fact that in the scottish clan system
 the lord lyon states that membership to a clan technically passes through the surname
 this means that children who bear their father
s surname belong to the father
s clan 
if any
 and that children who bear their mother
s surname 
her maiden name
 belong to their mother
s clan 
if any
 also
 the lord lyon states that a clan tartan should only be worn by those who profess allegiance to that clan
s chief
some clan societies even claim that certain tartans are the personal property of a chief or chieftain
 and in some cases they allow or deny their clansfolk 
permission
 to wear that tartan
dg
 according to the scottish tartans authority 
 which is an establishment of the scottish tartan industry 
 the balmoral tartan should not be worn by anyone who is not part of the british royal family
 even so
 some weavers outside of the united kingdom ignore the 
longstanding convention
 of the british royal family
s 
right
 to this tartan
 the society also claims that non
royals who wear this tartan are treated with 
great disdain
 by the scottish tartan industry
dh
generally
 a more liberal attitude had been taken by those in the business of selling tartan
 holding that anyone may wear any tartan they like
 under the liberal view
 claimed 
rules
 are mere conventions 
some of which are recent creations
 with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion
the standing council of scottish chiefs has also taken a fairly flexible position 
organisationally
 some specific individual chiefs may have a narrower or looser take
 and not all chiefs are members
 aside from opposing the creation of a new tartan using a clan
s name without the chief
s permission
 their website states
there are no strict rules on who has the right to wear a particular tartan
 people normally wear only the tartan 
if any
 of their surname
 or a 
district tartan
 connected with where they live or where their family come from
 wearing a particular clan tartan indicates that the wearer bears an allegiance to the chief of that clan
some highland dress historians have taken a dim view of regulatory intents and proclamations with regard to tartans
 scottish national portrait gallery curator a
 e
 haswell miller wrote that 
to claim special entitlement to a tartan in the same manner as heraldic arms is certainly absurd
 because evidence suggests that the idea was just invented by writers of the late 
th to mid
th centuries
 sir thomas dick lauder expressed similar views as far back as 
 right in the middle of the 
clan tartanry
 rush
 dismissing both the then
new adoption of 
official
 clan tartans and attempts by clans to claim regimental ones
in other cultures
while tartan has been most closely associated with scotland
 and dating back to the roman period was perhaps associated with northwestern europe in general
 it is likely that the idea of using patterns of rectangles and lines has independently occurred many times
 in any cultures with weaving
 basic tartan 
is almost as primitive a weave as it is possible to make 
 probably the earliest form of patterened fabric anywhere
 surviving pre
modern historical examples seem sparse
 however
modern tartan
style cloth in a wide variety of materials and patterns from simple to complex is available and used today around the world
 often simply as a style of cloth and without any association with scotland

 imported to the region by americans since the

 to be worn by higher

 the maasai were loosely allied with the british

 bringing tartan with them

 whether it relates at all to sh
 is unknown
 sh
 patterns usually lack the thin black lines common in scottish tartans
a nomadic cattle
pastoralist culture
 without their own weaving tradition
 the maasai have been described as unusually culturally conservative and resistant to modernisation
 nevertheless
 they have always engaged in trade to get goods they do not make themsevles
 and have made local traditional use of modern materials
 the maasai approach has been to resist yet assimilate colonial and post
colonial influences
although there is evidence of tartan usage among the maasai to at least the period 
 when walther dobbertin photographed a tartan sh
 in what was then german east africa
 the current bright tartan and striped style of sh
 appears to have been adopted primarily in the 
partly in response to national
level clothing modernisation pressure
 supplanting leather but keeping the same form
factor
 the shift in outward form without affecting function led one writer to quip that maasai dress 
has undergone dramatic changes while not changing at all
 tartan
patterned cloth is not typically used for other maasai garments besides sh
the sh
 has become so emblematic of the maasai that there is some discussion 
driven by the maasai themselves
 at the national and regional level about protecting it as a form of cultural property
 while it has been claimed that sh
 patterns
 at least at one time
 conveyed particular meanings

 traditional madras is hand
woven from lumpy
 carded
cotton thread
 and coloured with natural dyes which may bleed together upon washing to create a more muted pattern than typical tartan
 as well as a rougher texture
 madras also has a 
softer
 look because it typically lacks the black lines found in most scottish tartans
 madras cloth dates to at least the

 produced in a variety of patterns
 including religious designs and floral prints
 it is unclear if tartan patterns were among the original designs
 though they became very popular later
 weaving

 major production of this style of cloth also took place in cambay state
